## Description

The 'Expense Tracker' online tool efficiently manages daily spending with a
versatile layout that adjusts seamlessly for desktops, tablets, and mobiles at
1440, 768, and 375 pixels. Core features include main, authentication,
transaction history, and primary transaction pages.

Global variables ensure consistent styling, and fonts are integrated. Redux
manages states, storing the user's token in localStorage via redux-persist.

Responsive design, up to 375 pixels, introduces components like DecorationTab
for balances and UserPanel for user settings.

Private and public routes, determined by user authorization, are implemented
with components like SharedLayout, BgImageWrapper, Header, handling rendering
and interactions for both authorized and unauthorized users.
